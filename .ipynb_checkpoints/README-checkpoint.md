# PyBer_Analysis

# Description
In this project, we build a variety of charts, we will leverage our knowledge of Python arrays and turples, and learn how to apply Pandas methods, functions, and conditional expresion, as well as perform mathematical calculations on Series and DataFrames.

## Challenge Task
You have been tasked by a CEO to create an overall snapshot of the ride-sharing data. She would like to see scatter and pie charts as well as a summary table of key metrics of the ride-sharing data by city type, and a multiple-line graph that shows the average fare for each week by each city type.

## Approach
* Use Pandas functions like groupby, pivot, resample, and reset_index on a DataFrame.
* Use Pandas methods and attributes on a DataFrame or Series.
* Create a newDataFrame from multiple groupby() Series.
* Format columns of a DataFrame.
* Create a multiple-line graph.
* Annotate and apply styling to the chart.
